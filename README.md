# Southern Poverty Law Centre Consolidated Data 2000 - 2019

This repo contains consolidated data from the [Southern Poverty Law Centre](https://www.splcenter.org/)'s [Hatewatch](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch) monitoring programme in the United States. If you use this data for a project, please consider donating to the SPLC [here](https://donate.splcenter.org/) to support their work. All data rights are owned by the Southern Poverty Law Centre.

## Data Dimensions

- Data is updated by the SPLC on a yearly basis, usually in the first three months of the year.
- Currently consists of 17k rows across 11 fields.
- Where an organisation is referred to as "statewide", the centroid corresponds to the geographic centre of that state, rather than a specific location (e.g. state capital).

## Organisational Background

The Southern Poverty Law Centre was founded in 1971 to ensure that laws passed as a result of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's were practiced in the southern states, where Jim Crow practices had strong support.

The centre's work as a law practice has struck discriminatory laws from state and federal statute books and shuttered some of the most violent white supremacist groups through legal action.

In the 1980s, the group started monitoring hate groups due to a rise in Ku Klux Klan activity - this project continues, and forms the basis of the data collected here.

## Data Background

In the last 18 months the SPLC has done considerable work in tidying up their historic databases, which track the existence of hate groups over time, operating in the United States. The aim for this repo is to provide up to date, geocoded consolidated repos of this information for use by others. The data is only updated on a yearly basis, and the original SPLC data does not come with geocoding. The geocoding was executed by Google Maps Places API.
